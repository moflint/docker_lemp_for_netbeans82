# docker_lemp_for_netbeans82
docker, linux, nginx1.20, php8.1, xdebug3, mysql8.0, phpmyadmin5

This is a setup for using xdebug3 with netbeans 8.2.

Taken from a tutorial at https://tech.osteel.me/posts/docker-for-local-web-development-part-1-a-basic-lemp-stack

I think the only configuration not included in this repo is: add test.php (referenced in .docker/nginx/conf.d/php.conf) to your hosts file.
